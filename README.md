#Statistical Test for Designing Tournament Selection in Genetic Programming


This code provides a Java implementation of statistics tournament selection methods as described in "Statistical Test for Designing Tournament Selection in
Genetic Programming"  by Thi Huong Chu et al.

# Methods:
+ GP/GP: Standard Tournament Selection,
+ GP/TS-R: Statistics tournament selection with random,
+ GP/TS-S: Statistics test tournament selection with size,
+ GP/TS-P: Statistics tournament selection with probability,l
+ GP/RDO: Crossover- random desired operator (RDO),
+ GP/TS-RDO:The method which combines TS-S with RDO.
# Evolutionary Parameter Values:
You can set evolutionary parameter values in file GP/Common/
